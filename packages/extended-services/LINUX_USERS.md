# GNOME Shell users (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, etc)

If you're using a GNOME Shell based desktop environment, please make sure that your OS has AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem support enabled (via patch or GNOME Shell Extension).

You can also install this GNOME Shell extension to make sure you can see and manage the application via App Indicator on your taskbar:

- https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/

# All users

This application can run without an app indicator, via terminal:

- `./kie_sandbox_extended_services`

NOTE: You may need to give execution permissions to the executable:

- `chmod +x kie_sandbox_extended_services`
